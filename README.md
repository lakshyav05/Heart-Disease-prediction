Project Description:
I made this project named Heart Disease Prediction System developed using Machine Learning.
This system estimates the possibility of a person developing heart disease based on medical parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and heart rate.
In this project, I used logistic regression, which is a supervised learning algorithm and it is suitable for binary classification problems.
This entire project is implemented in Python using Google Colab and Scikit-learn.
This project was developed as part of a BCA final semester/minor project and this is fully functional.
